File descriptions

train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows).
test.csv - Input features for the test set (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row.

Data fields

ID
key - Unique string identifying each row in both the training and test sets. Comprised of pickup_datetime plus a unique integer, but this doesn't matter, it should just be used as a unique ID field. Required in your submission CSV. Not necessarily needed in the training set, but could be useful to simulate a 'submission file' while doing cross-validation within the training set.

Features
pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the taxi ride started.
pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
passenger_count - integer indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.

Target
fare_amount - float dollar amount of the cost of the taxi ride. This value is only in the training set; this is what you are predicting in the test set and it is required in your submission CSV.
